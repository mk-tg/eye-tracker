Project Title: CSS Eye Movement

Description: This project utilizes Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript to create the appearance of eyes that follow the mouse around the screen. This listens for active mouse movement to adjust the eyes. (Note: limited funcationality on mobile devices)

How to Run: Move your mouse around the screen on a laptop or desktop device to watch the eyes move and follow your mouse pointer.

Roadmap of Future Improvements:

Inputs and buttons for the user to generate additional sets of eyes
A button that reverses where the eyes are looking (i.e. press once to have the eyes follow the mouse and press again to have them look away)
Color selection for the background
